## Setup

You can use Docker Image

The current version of the project is 1.2, which is considered the most stable and reliable release available. This version has undergone extensive testing and debugging to ensure a high level of stability and performance.

```
docker pull xandouglas/switchsetup:v1.2
docker run -p 8000:8000 --name switchsetup -d xandouglas/switchsetup:v1.2
```

After creating the image, use for login:
```
Username: admin
Password: 123
```

Once inside the system, you have the capability to manage your users and their credentials effectively.

To set up the project locally, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/AleDouglas/SwitchSetup.git`
2. Install the for ansible and Django in requirements.txt .
3. You need generate your own [Secret Key](#SecretKey).
4. [Configure your .env](#configure-.env)
5. You can run it in [your terminal or dockerfile](#run-switchsetup)


## SecretKey

Start the **Python interpreter**
```
import secrets
secrets.token_hex(32)
Copy the key in .env
```
Be mindful that you can generate a new key whenever necessary. 
However, it is crucial to remember that if you are using our project, you should not disclose the key to anyone.

## Configure .env

Create an .env file in the /core directory:
```
SECRET_KEY=SECRET KEY
DEBUG=True
```
**Use DEBUG=TRUE only when in development.**

## Run SwitchSetup

#### Terminal Local:

```
cd WebApi
python manage.py runserver
```

#### Dockerfile:

```
docker build -t image_name
docker run -p 8000:8000 image_name
```
## Database

We use SQLite at first, but it is possible to manage other databases.

Use [Django's](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/databases/) own reference.

If you lose the database file or decide to switch to a different one, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Migration ( **Inside the WebApi file** )


```
python manage.py migrate
```

After this, a new admin user with the username "admin" and password "123" is automatically created.

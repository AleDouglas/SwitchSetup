<p>This software is designed to configure network devices using Ansible, assisting configurations of many equipment.</p>
<p>Feel free to contribute to the project.</p>
<h3 id="#advantage">Advantage</h3>
<p>The main advantage of this Software, if you are on a network with access to the equipment</p>
<p>you will be able to configure it through a cell phone for example.</p>
<h3 id="#how-work">How Work</h3>
<p>To establish a connection with the equipment, you will need the SSH credentials, including the username and password. </p>
<p>Once connected, you can access the configuration interface where you </p>
<p>provide the relevant user and password information, </p>
<p>specify the equipment (Host) you want to access, and define the commands to be executed (Playbook).</p>
